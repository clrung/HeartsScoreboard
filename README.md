This is a scoreboard for the [Hearts playing card game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts).

## Motivation
I have always wanted to have an app in Apple's App Store, and decided to create an app to track Hearts scores after I found myself using a pencil and paper to record scores (gasp!).
This app was particularly attractive to me because it is easily extendable; after I completed the bare bones app, I could use things like CloudKit to sync game state and settings across users' iOS devices.

## Design
I purposefully kept the look flat and simple to comply with modern mobile app design standards.
